The goal of 'readgmt' is to easily import a GMT file from [MSigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) as a list of gene sets.

See the full documentation [here](https://jhrcook.github.io/readgmt).

## Installation

You can install the released version of 'readgmt' from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("readgmt")
```

Or get the development version with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jhrcook/readgmt")
```


## Example

Here is an example of reading in the KEGG gene set (downloaded on 2019/04/01).

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(readgmt)
kegg_path <- system.file("extdata", "c2.cp.kegg.v6.2.symbols.gmt.txt",
                         package = "readgmt")
kegg <- read_gmt(kegg_path)
head(names(kegg))
head(kegg$KEGG_COLORECTAL_CANCER)
```
